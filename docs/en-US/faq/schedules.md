 ## It seems that the scheduled task does not take effect
 * Is `自冻(freezeyou)` the latest version?
 * Is `self-freezing (freezeyou)` added to the background whitelist of the system?  (Including but not limited to allowing background operation, ignoring battery optimization)

 ## Did not turn on the cellular mobile data network as planned
 * The activation of cellular data network is currently only supported on devices with `android 4.4 and below` or `root privileges` or `self-freezing freezeyou have been installed as a high-privilege system application`.
 * Check whether to authorize the `Switch mobile network` permission.
